                <p>Lab Monsters are the fringe, multiple zone dwellers of the lab. They include the entities that are called to use under the sterile hood, entities that are created within (and of) the lab and those who enact within the lab (bioartists).
                    These monsters are marginal bodies—not as the othered victims of marginalisation—but as powerful entities able to inhabit and infiltrate zones where knowledge is constructed and contested. Lab monsters are powerfully positioned and
                    are able to disrupt power structures because of their abilities to cross through and inhabit these multiple zones (lab-non-scientist/humanities-science/woman-science-art etc.). Multiple zone dwellers are marginal, troublesome, threatening—</p>

                <p>This commentary however is not about women in the lab or feminist art practice per say, rather it is intended to draw conversational correlations that identify important and powerful statements that are made consciously or not enacted
                    by subjugated, marginal or intentionally contestable entities within locations of knowledge construction. Women’s discourse is automatically implicated in this respect and cannot be avoided when bodies of marginality or infiltration
                    work in the lab. Ecofeminism is one of these discourses which describes the interweaving of feminism and ecological/environmental concerns. Ecofeminism utilises the definitions of ecology which is ‘a science that deals with the relationships
                    between groups of living things and their environments’[i] coupled with feminism which concerns generally gender equity by commenting, acting upon or questioning male dominated structures/positions of power. Situated in the subject
                    of biology, ecofeminism manifests as a discourse that deals with the power structures situated around, and applied upon, the relationships between living things and their environments. This is particularly relevant when considering
                    alternatives to the knowledge and power constructs of Biology through the establishment of new ‘models of cooperation’ rather than ‘domination’ over nature, humans and the nonhuman world.[ii]</p>

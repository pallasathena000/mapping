                <p>In Haruki Murakami's novel, <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>, which explores the history of media development, a man's wife disappears and he embarks on a journey to find her. This journey is carried out through various forms of media,
                    including body fluid exchange, psychic communication, oral history, written messages, and television broadcasts. Eventually, the medium that leads him to his wife is the computer network. In the last chapters of the book, the protagonist
                    is directed to a computer in a secret room, where he activates a communication program with a password and gains access to communicate with his lost wife on a regular basis. Terms such as "designated time" "access code" "communication
                    program" and "telecommunication" were once associated with science fiction, but in 2020, the year zero of the Pandemic Era, these terms became the new norm for nearly all households.</p>

                <p>During the coronavirus outbreak, it felt like a survival experiment on a global scale. The once-normalized concepts of space and time no longer exist: space is now limited to the size of a home, and time is filled with blanks. At the same
                    time, the threat of disease and death is pervasive. Leaving home entails the risk of infection. How do humans recognize each other's existence in this new reality? The answer is that existence is mediated. People have shifted their
                    lifeworld into the virtual world, abandoning the phenomenal body and transitioning to the symbolic body. The network of social relations has taken on its maximum digital form, and information is now reduced to its most basic form,
                    a binary sequence carrying every fragment of life. Humanity has been forced to abandon the offline earth and upload almost all communication and network to create a digital version of the earth. Our progeny might see this as a great
                    migration, or the spectacle of boarding Noah's Ark. Interestingly, the choice to go online happened coincidentally in almost all countries, as the medium for this digital migration had already existed.</p>

                <p>The great migration is happening on all fronts, including the art system. Under the policy of social isolation, the initial exhibition plans for 2020 were disrupted. Physical exhibitions were difficult to implement, so art workers shifted
                    to the online world. Decisions were made overnight, websites were erected in droves, and online exhibitions began to proliferate as a substitute for physical exhibitions. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 era, 2020 showed a growth in both
                    quantity and quality of online exhibitions worldwide, making the internetisation of art events the primary phenomenon in the global art system during the epidemic. Alongside the internetisation of exhibitions, art events moved to conference
                    software and live streaming platforms, with various online screening rooms, workshops, seminars, and live art streaming events, connecting artists, curators, and audiences together into virtual spaces through QR codes, URL links, and
                    passwords. The year 2020 is the first in the 21st century, and although the online presence of art is a contingency plan, the Internet frontier for art has already been expanded. The year 2020 is the "digital year" for contemporary
                    art to leap online.</p>

                <p>This article focuses on one part of the online art scene: the online exhibition. According to Wikipedia, an online exhibition is an exhibition that takes place in cyberspace. It has various names such as virtual exhibitions, online galleries,
                    and cyber-exhibitions, which have basically the same meaning with slightly different emphasis. Studying online exhibitions is significant because they are not only an emerging trend in the art field but also an experimental pioneer
                    of digitalisation in other fields. If the experience and model of online exhibitions are applied to other fields, it can be incubated into many forms such as future art museums, future university education, future movies and games,
                    future digital fashion weeks, digital fairs, digital publishing, etc. This provides a preliminary direction for the way of civilisation communication in the post-human era. Therefore, the study of online exhibitions is cutting-edge
                    and necessary. However, for this new historical process, we are still in the middle of it, and it is difficult to retreat from a certain distance to conduct a more in-depth study at present. The history of domestic online exhibitions
                    is relatively short, and there are fewer studies on online exhibitions before 2020. Therefore, this paper collects, sorts, and summarises online documents from February 2020 to March 2021 as first-hand information.</p>

                <p>There are two reasons to intervene in online exhibitions with the method of media studies. One is because the most essential feature of online curatorial exhibitions is the curatorial behaviour unfolding on the Internet, and the other
                    is because the field of media studies is closely related to the fields of new media art, philosophy of technology, and communication, etc. Theory research can be found in writings of Boris Groys, Siegfried Zielinski, Alexander R. Galloway,
                    and many more scholars. Running through my essay, there are two threads of media studies methodology, one is from continental philosophy, from Heidegger's phenomenology, to Stiegler (a student of Deleuze), to Stiegler's student Yuk
                    Hui's "On the Existence of Digital Objects" they make an important contribution to clarifying the concept of cyberspace. This thread continues to ZKM, Center for Media Art Karlsruhe, Germany, whose Chinese editor Zhang Ga is the curator
                    of several online exhibitions 2020 New Time Art Centre in China. The second thread is from American cultural studies and media studies, starting with an important part of interface studies and network structure from Frederick Jameson's
                    student Alexander Galloway ("The Interface Effect" and "Protocols: How Control Exists After Decentralisation"), and many of the documents in this paper on curating online exhibitions come from Michael Conner's writings and seminars,
                    and both Galloway and Conner have worked at Rhizome. Conner was also involved in a number of art events related to the 2020 online exhibition in China. Both of these threads ultimately converge in China 2020.</p>

                <p>The title of this article, "Mapping the Infinite Land," comes from the fact that although I have been focusing on online curation for the past year, I have increasingly felt that online exhibitions are an ongoing phenomenon. The space
                    of these exhibitions is a sprawling field, and the Internet space itself is an infinite land. I used the word "mapping" because I hope to grasp its general shape, but I am unable to survey the whole picture at the moment. So, I will
                    be like a cave explorer, a pioneer, or a cartographer, riding on the boat of the medium, using references and setting up landmarks to discover this new world with infinite possibilities.</p>
